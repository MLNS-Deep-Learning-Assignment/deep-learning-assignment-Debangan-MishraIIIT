    "The given task is such that we are given an input image, and we are predicting the sum of the numbers represented in the image. If there is no guarantee as to whether the test set contains exactly 4 numbers, the typical classifier approach will likely fail. As a result, we can modify the network to act as a regressor with a single output and the output value being rounded to get an integer representation. Hence, during training, the model will use MSE Loss (typically used for regression tasks) and will round the number to closest integer during inference to calculate accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as a result of this approach, a low MSE Loss need not translate to a good accuracy. Consider for example, our model predicts 24.6 as an output while the ground truth is 24. In this case, the MSE Loss will be low, but the accuracy need not be as rounding changes the output. Also note that it is not possible to train the model based on rounded outputs as rounding is a step function with zero gradient almost everywhere making it useless for learning. "

    "### Classifier Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are assuming that the input image will always have 4 numbers as that is the only value appearing in the dataset. In that case, we can model the network as a classifier with the outputs ranging from 0 to 36. For this case, we can use the cross entropy loss which is commonly used for classification task. Empirically we observe that the model performance on the validation split is lower for the classifier than it is for the regressor. This might be because regression operates in the continuous space (just like the input) and this possibly allows for a smoother optimization. It is not possible to verify why the regressor works better than the classifier case. "

Note that a convolutional layer is also prepended to ensure that the MNIST dataset with one channel is compatible with the VGG network that is trained on 3 channel RGB images.
